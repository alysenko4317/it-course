# Prof2IT: Course "Information Systems: from OOP to Telegram Bot"

## Overview
This repository tracks the progress of the **Prof2IT** professional development course titled **"Information Systems: from OOP to Telegram Bot"**. The course explores the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), principles of building information systems, and the development of a Telegram bot. 

The repository contains completed homework assignments that were part of the course curriculum. These assignments collectively form a comprehensive **diploma project**—a fully functional Telegram bot.

## Project Highlights
The final diploma project is implemented as a **Dockerized system** comprising multiple components:
- A Telegram bot application written in Python.
- An MVC-style web application developed in PHP.
